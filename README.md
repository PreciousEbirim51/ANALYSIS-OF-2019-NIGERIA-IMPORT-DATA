INTRODUCTION

This analysis examines Nigeria's import data for 2019, a crucial year before the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted global trade patterns. Understanding Nigeria's import profile provides insights into the country's economic dependencies, industrial needs, and consumption patterns. This analysis serves as a foundation for understanding Nigeria's trade dynamics and can inform policy decisions regarding industrial development, trade partnerships, and economic diversification efforts.

PRE ANALYSIS

A pre-analysis phase was conducted to establish an analytical framework before the creation of the dashboard. This pre-analysis phase involves:

1.	Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.

2.	Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing during the analysis.

3.	Potential Insights: I was able to uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.

4.	Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Microsoft Power BI was the primary analysis and visualization tool used for this project, the Power BI features used include;
•	DAX Functions
•	Interactive Visualizations
•	Power Query
•	Calculated Columns and Measures
•	Conditional Formatting

OBSERVATIONS

1.	The top imported items in Nigeria are; Gasoil, Machinery and accessories, Agricultural machinery, Industrial raw materials, whole milk instant powder, Telecommunication equipment, Agricultural Herbicide and Bajaj Motorcycle.

2.	Letters of credit were mostly used by the importers for trade settlement due to the low trust in the society and it is safer for the exporter. This payment method also provides the importer access to facilities from the Banking institutions for the trade settlement.

3.	Zenith Bank handled over 1.5 trillion Naira value of transaction which is two times what Access bank did in the same year, so this goes to show that the importers trust and prefer the institution for their transaction.

4.	The top importers are mostly from the manufacturing and oil sector mostly because of the use of industrial raw materials and advanced machineries which are not manufactured in Nigeria. 

5.	The revenue generation capacity of the whole eco system is outstanding ranging from the importer, exporter, Nigerian custom service and the middle-men (the clearing and forwarding Agents) which greatly affects the Nigerian economy.

RECOMMENDATION

There is great need to revamp the Nigerian industrial complex which will greatly reduce the nation's reliance on imported materials and goods and indirectly reduce the pressure on the Naira.
There is need for the Agencies or ministries to play their part in plugging the revenue leakages from these transactions as the Duty payments are being made.

The consumers and importers need to be sensitized on the advantages of patronizing the local industries and how their actions affect the overall economy so as to gain their support and investment in the budding local industries thereby Promoting Import Substitution & Local Manufacturing.

Conclusion

Nigeria’s heavy import dependence presents both a challenge and an opportunity. By implementing strategies and initiatives to reduce this dependence, the country can reduce its import bill, stimulate local industries, and create jobs while building a more sustainable and resilient economy.
